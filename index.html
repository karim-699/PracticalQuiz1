                <h3>Nature</h3>
                <p>
                    Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural world, physical universe,
                    material world or material universe. "Nature" refers to the phenomena
                    of the physical world, and also to life in general.

                <p>
                    Manufactured objects and human interaction are, in common usage, not
                    considered part of nature unless qualified in ways such as "human
                    nature" or "the whole of nature".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nature is generally distinguished from the supernatural. It ranges
                    in scale from the subatomic to the galactic.

                <h3>Earth</h3>
                <p>
                    Earth (or, "the earth") the fifth largest planet in the solar system,
                    third in order of distance from the Sun. It is the largest of its
                    planetary system's terrestrial planets and the only place in the
                    universe known to support life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most prominent features of the earth's climate are its two large
                    polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide
                    equatorial tropical to subtropical region.

                    Precipitation patterns vary widely according to location.

                <h3>Life</h3>
                <p>
                    Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life,
                    scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of
                    life is characterized by organization, metabolism, growth,
                    adaptation, response to stimuli and reproduction.
